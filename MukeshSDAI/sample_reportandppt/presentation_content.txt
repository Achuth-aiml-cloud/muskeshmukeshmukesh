SLIDE 2: MOTIVATION
================================
The COVID-19 pandemic has generated unprecedented volumes of social media data, with millions of people sharing their experiences, symptoms, and concerns on platforms like Twitter. Analyzing this vast amount of unstructured data presents both a challenge and an opportunity for public health monitoring. Our goal is to create an intelligent system that can detect disease-related tweets, extract symptom information, analyze sentiment patterns, and identify geographic hotspots using Big Data and AI/ML techniques. This will enable early detection of disease spread patterns and help public health authorities make data-driven decisions.

================================
SLIDE 3: SIGNIFICANCE
================================
This project is significant because it demonstrates the power of combining Big Data technologies with advanced AI/ML techniques to solve real-world public health challenges.

By leveraging deep learning models like BERT alongside traditional machine learning algorithms, we can analyze massive volumes of social media data to identify disease-related patterns, extract symptom information, and predict sentiment trends.

The project's outcomes can help public health authorities with early warning systems, identify emerging hotspots, monitor public sentiment during health crises, and improve resource allocation for healthcare services.
